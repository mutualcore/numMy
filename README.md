<h1>numMy</h1>

Welcome to my capstone project for my Bloc apprenticeship! I am still working on launching the project, but it's almost ready. For my capstone I was given free reign to complete a project of my own from the ground up, with guidance from my course mentor Bobbilee Hartman. The idea is for numMy to be a personalized recipes app that provides recipes based off of the ingredients you already have! Users can input their ingredients into a virtual 'kitchen', then search for recipes that use only (but not necessarily ALL of) their ingredients. 

For this project, I learned how to use an API to call a pre-existing database, so I didn't have to type up all the recipes myself. I used the Yummly API for this. The program performs a call for each ingredient, and then filters the results to ensure the ingredients list of each recipe is contained within the user's kitchen. The matching recipes are returned to the user.

As of now, I am still working to provide individual recipe show pages so that the user can click on each of their search results. Ultimately I would like to add user accounts as well, so that users can save recipes to their profiles.
